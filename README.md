ðŸ¦• Rustin deno, need I say more? ðŸ¦•

## Why?
Rust provides a super useful core crate which we should use to our advantage. While this can make our code more verbose, it ensures that we also don't end up with a mess in the end.

Yep typescript is a big help for some things, this just adds that little bit of extra on top.

## Docs
Instead of a long list of what you can do here, I'll point you to the [docs](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/x/rustin/mod.ts). There's a much nicer layout, examples, and proper styling.

## Tests
Everything, in true Rust fashion, comes complete with a test to make sure:
- it works
- there's no regression

If you make a pull request, which is more than welcome, please try to include
tests for the things you add. Thanks!
